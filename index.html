        I am <b>Aronnya pal</b>, a student of VIT Vellore currently pursuing my
        bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science in the branch CSE (core). I am 19
        years of age, about to be 20 on the 27th of december this year.<br />
        I was born in Siliuguri, West Bengal, and currently reside in
        Kolkata.<br />I have completed my higher secondary education from the
        respected Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, where I studied from classes 2
        to 12.

        I am mostly interested in various fields related to Computer Science
        with some of the main ones being:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Video Games</strong> : I not only like playing video games,
          but also like learning about the processes that go in the making of
          said games, with some examples of them being:
          <ul style="line-height: 1.5em">
            <li>
              Learning about the lore and art direction about the story in games
            </li>
            <li>
              Learning about how the score (music) complements the story telling
              and overall enviornment in games and media as a whole
            </li>

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keyboards</strong> : I like to learn about how keyboards are
          built, and about keyboard modding for making them sound better, making
          the keys smoother for smoother typing etc.
        </li>
      </ol>

        As for my future, I want to pursue higher education abroad, focusing on
        the practical applications of <b>parallel computing</b>. I am fascinated
        by its ability to enhance performance by dividing tasks across
        processors, especially in areas like
        <em>video games, data analysis, and machine learning</em>. By deepening
        my understanding of this field, I hope to develop innovative solutions
        that improve software efficiency and provide seamless user experiences,
        contributing to the advancement of technology in everyday life.
